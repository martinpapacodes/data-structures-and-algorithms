# Code Challenge 2: ArrayShift
Shift an array by inserting a value to the midpoint.

## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
If the size of an array is even, divide the size by 2. If odd, then divide by 2 then add .5. Insert the value to the index.

# Code Challenge 3: Binary Search
Search an array for a given key and return its index.

## Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
