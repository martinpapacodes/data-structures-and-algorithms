# Code Challenge 2: ArrayShift
Shift an array by inserting a value to the midpoint.

## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
If the size of an array is even, divide the size by 2. If odd, then divide by 2 then add .5. Insert the value to the index.
